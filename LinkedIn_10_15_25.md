### **About**

I build systems that merge **intelligence, commerce, and infrastructure.**

After 25 years leading design and automation in fashion and manufacturing, I pivoted into full-stack software development and AI infrastructure—where I now operate at the intersection of **AI/ML**, **Web3**, **quantitative finance**, and **creator economies.**

As founder of **Immutability.Space**, I design modular, agentic systems that connect humans, algorithms, and economies. My work merges **blockchain interoperability**, **local AI deployment**, and **data sovereignty**, creating architectures where creativity, content, and capital flow freely—securely owned, locally run, globally connected.

My projects span **algorithmic trading**, **tokenized asset exchanges**, **creator streaming ecosystems**, and **renewable energy tokenization**, combining deterministic engineering with creative systems design. I build for a future where autonomy, provenance, and intelligence aren’t services—they’re **rights.**

Now available for **Fractional CTO**, **System Design, Advisory** and **Project Manager Roles** — helping teams scale AI-native, secure, and observable systems.

**Core Strengths:**

* End-to-end architecture of distributed AI/ML pipelines  
* Hybrid edge \+ cloud deployments (Cloudflare / Supabase / FastAPI)  
* Advanced tokenomics and smart contract systems (Solidity / Rust)  
* Quant and causal modeling (Monte Carlo, DeepAR, LSTM)  
* Scalable observability & automation (Prometheus, Grafana, LangGraph)

OLD

Left my mark on the Apparel Industry. Multidisciplinary fashion professional with decades of experience in innovative product development and distribution technology platforms. Multimillion dollar successes across several product categories and retail levels. Early mover in the DTC \- on demand production space. 

Spent the past 36 months working with startups to determine functional applications for tokenization within both digital Assets and IRL IP for cross-functional disceplins. It is not a question of IF we will adopt blockchain \- but How we will integrate it into trade and finance

Bringing industries together. Creating business. I am an advocate for interoperable solutions between metaverse and IRL consumer products, proponent for the adoption of tokenization across multiple asset classes, and champion for the ethical integration of AI into IP driven industries.

Strange fascination with microbes and fungi, and I believe that nature is the key to solving all of our industrial problems. Carbon sequestration, and soil amendment will be integral to creating a sustainable international carbon offset credit system. All energy should be renewable. Our carbon footprint will be zero. Tokenized fractionalization of Renewable Energy Credits is the future of commerce, and Green Energy is the only commodity worth backing a potential global reserve currency.

Horse Trader, Connector, Swiss Army Knife. Deploying my unique set of tools to make the world a better place.  
—  
Head of West coast operations for Utherverse.io in Los Angeles, tasked with  bringing a legacy 3D VR Metaverse company up to date and in line with Web3, blockchain evolution. This included implementation of a world cryptocurrency, deployment of functional NFTs for in-world goods, and innovations for search, interoperability, licensing, and affiliate programs. As a member of the founding team, acted as liaison between design, technology, biz dev, and sales. I worked closely with the founder and CEO to redefine company mission and messaging and write the white paper designing our value proposition.

The artwork of Michael John is marked by a sharp commentary on the state of the 'American Dream,' and its impending decline amidst the cacophony of popular culture. His stark deconstructed forms, rendered in a style that is both rich and visually arresting, focus on taking fluid social concepts and literally stitching them down to the fabric of culture...as if to pause them in time. 

His work is a psychic trip through the funhouse that is the American psyche, exploring the signs and signifiers that both structure and befuddle the Western way of life. His canvas is Our Collective Dream, Our Collective Illusion, Our America.
