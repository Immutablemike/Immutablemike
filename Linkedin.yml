LINKED IN

My Linked In is fucked and Old - Lets use what is here as baseline to refresh what you've built - early career detail is not so important - neither is my artistic work - 

Also if there are other sections that a good linked in needs - lets get after it


ABOUT - Section

Left my mark on the Apparel Industry. Multidisciplinary fashion professional with decades of experience in innovative product development and distribution technology platforms. Multimillion dollar successes across several product categories and retail levels. Early mover in the DTC - on demand production space. 

Spent the past 36 months working with startups to determine functional applications for tokenization within both digital Assets and IRL IP for cross-functional disceplins. It is not a question of IF we will adopt blockchain - but How we will integrate it into trade and finance

Bringing industries together. Creating business. I am an advocate for interoperable solutions between metaverse and IRL consumer products, proponent for the adoption of tokenization across multiple asset classes, and champion for the ethical integration of AI into IP driven industries.

Strange fascination with microbes and fungi, and I believe that nature is the key to solving all of our industrial problems. Carbon sequestration, and soil amendment will be integral to creating a sustainable international carbon offset credit system. All energy should be renewable. Our carbon footprint will be zero. Tokenized fractionalization of Renewable Energy Credits is the future of commerce, and Green Energy is the only commodity worth backing a potential global reserve currency.

Horse Trader, Connector, Swiss Army Knife. Deploying my unique set of tools to make the world a better place.

The artwork of Michael John is marked by a sharp commentary on the state of the 'American Dream,' and its impending decline amidst the cacophony of popular culture. His stark deconstructed forms, rendered in a style that is both rich and visually arresting, focus on taking fluid social concepts and literally stitching them down to the fabric of culture...as if to pause them in time. 

His work is a psychic trip through the funhouse that is the American psyche, exploring the signs and signifiers that both structure and befuddle the Western way of life. His canvas is Our Collective Dream, Our Collective Illusion, Our America.

In my Capacity as Head Technical Designer, and Production Manager I made sure that all of the product that went out the door fit right, and was constructed correctly. I touched every Garment, Accessory, and Piece of Hardware that was created and followed it through production. I wrestled with Vendors all over the world to make sure we got what we wanted when we needed it. Kicked Ass wearing both hats as both Production Manager and Technical Designer – which is unheard of!
